# MoviesDB

This is a Spring Boot project that dynamically displays information about movies using JSP. The data for the movies are taken from TMDB using their API. The data is given in JSON format and I used JSON.simple library to take in all the data I needed. After that I stored the data in the database using Hibernate.
